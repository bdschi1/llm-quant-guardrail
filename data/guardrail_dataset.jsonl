{"scenario_file": "draft_portfolio_ideas_style_tilt_tariffs.md", "label_file": "style_tilt_tariffs_guardrail_verdict_example.json", "raw_idea_text": "This document represents the raw output from an upstream \"Analyst LLM\" or a junior PM's initial proposal. It lacks the quantitative risk and portfolio context that the PM Guardrail Agents will enforce.\n\nThe PM Guardrail Agent will read this text and the associated data, and transform it into a decision, an IC-style narrative, and a machine-readable JSON verdict.\n\n---\n\n## Idea 1: Long Proposal (STYLE-TILT GROWTH BENEFICIARY)\n\nTicker: NOVA\nDirection: LONG\nProposed Notional Size: $10,000,000\nImplied Volatility (60-day): 38%\nCrowding Indicator: High (Top 10 active weight in many quality-growth funds; overlapping ownership with large-cap AI and software names)\nSector/Theme: Industrials / Automation and Precision Manufacturing\nBeta: 1.3\nStyle Exposure: High Growth, Quality, Momentum\nExisting Book Context: The current long book is already tilted toward quality-growth and AI-adjacent names; underweight cyclicals and value; limited exposure to pure tariff beneficiaries.\nBorrow Cost: N/A (long only)\nIdiosyncratic Alpha Estimate: Medium-High (strong product moat and structural automation tailwind)\nTariff Impact: NOVA has a mostly domestic production footprint and modest direct exposure to import tariffs, but many of its customers are exporters who may face tariff pressure over time. Overall, the Analyst LLM views tariffs as a secondary risk factor, not the core thesis driver.\nPortfolio NMV Impact: This position increases net long exposure in industrials by roughly 2.0% of portfolio NMV unless offset by trimming existing quality-growth longs.\nCatalyst Path (Next 6\u20139 Months): Two quarterly earnings prints with potential upside on order growth, a major trade expo where management plans to update medium-term targets, and potential incremental policy support for reshoring and automation.\nDraft Thesis: NOVA is a leading automation OEM benefiting from structural reshoring and factory automation trends. The Analyst LLM argues that the market is underestimating the durability of NOVA's order backlog and the margin leverage as volumes scale, particularly if reshoring accelerates in response to geopolitical tensions and tariff regimes. The proposed long is meant to be a core, multi-year compounder that complements existing AI and software exposure by owning the \"picks and shovels\" of physical automation.\nRisk Notes (Analyst Draft): The Analyst LLM notes that the book is already overweight quality-growth and that adding NOVA reinforces the existing style tilt. There is also some indirect tariff risk if trade tensions slow global capex or pressure NOVA's export-oriented customers. However, the LLM assumes that secular automation demand and potential policy support more than offset these risks, and does not explicitly propose offsetting trades or NMV adjustments elsewhere in the book.\n\n---\n\n## Idea 2: Short Proposal (VALUE CYCLICAL WITH TARIFF HEADWINDS)\n\nTicker: GLOX\nDirection: SHORT\nProposed Notional Size: $6,000,000\nImplied Volatility (60-day): 30%\nCrowding Indicator: Medium (popular value and dividend income name; not a consensus hedge fund short)\nSector/Theme: Industrials / Heavy Equipment and Export-Oriented Manufacturing\nBeta: 1.1\nStyle Exposure: Value, Cyclical, Dividend Yield\nBorrow Cost: Low (0.5% annualized)\nDays-to-Cover (DTC): 2.5 days\nIdiosyncratic Alpha Estimate: Medium (balance sheet and capital allocation concerns plus tariff and cyclical headwinds)\nExisting Book Context: The short book is currently heavy in low-quality, structurally challenged stories and underweight in more \"respectable\" value cyclicals. Factor-wise, the book is short low-quality and junk factors, but does not explicitly hedge the quality-growth tilt in the long book.\nTariff Impact: GLOX has meaningful exposure to cross-border trade and relies heavily on imported components. New and proposed tariffs raise input costs and could compress margins if the company is unable to pass through prices. The Analyst LLM frames tariffs as an incremental margin headwind and potential catalyst for estimate cuts over the next 12\u201318 months.\nPortfolio NMV Impact: The proposed short reduces net market value exposure to cyclicals by approximately 1.3% of portfolio NMV and modestly offsets some of the long book's industrial exposure, but does not materially change the overall quality-growth tilt.\nCatalyst Path (Next 6\u20139 Months): Several known catalysts including two earnings reports, a tariff review cycle that could introduce new import duties on key components, and industry order-book data that may confirm a slowdown in global demand.\nDraft Thesis: The Analyst LLM views GLOX as a late-cycle, export-oriented industrial trading at a full valuation given rising input costs and slowing end markets. The thesis is that incremental tariffs and weaker volumes will pressure margins and drive a modest de-rating, producing an attractive risk-reward short over a 12\u201318 month horizon. The short is also framed as partially offsetting the increased industrial exposure from adding NOVA on the long side.\nRisk Notes (Analyst Draft): Key risks include the possibility that GLOX passes through tariffs successfully and maintains margins, or that tariffs are rolled back, reducing the perceived headwind. There is also some risk that this short does not meaningfully hedge the style tilt of the book, since GLOX is a higher-quality industrial within the value/cyclical cohort. The Analyst LLM acknowledges these points but concludes that valuation and tariff-related margin risk justify the position, without explicitly quantifying how much portfolio NMV or factor risk is being neutralized.\n\n\n", "pm_verdict": {"NOVA": {"ticker": "NOVA", "direction": "LONG", "overall_ok": false, "guardrail_flags": ["reinforces_existing_quality_growth_tilt", "factor_concentration_risk", "insufficient_explicit_offset_for_added_industrials_nmv", "tariff_risk_underanalyzed"], "risk_assessment": {"gross_exposure_ok": true, "single_name_volatility_high": true, "factor_risk_dominant": true, "style_tilt_reinforced": true, "portfolio_nmv_impact_not_addressed": true, "tariff_exposure_secondary_but_real": true}, "pm_recommendation": "Treat as a second-tier long idea; only add after reducing other quality-growth industrials to keep style tilt and industrial NMV within risk budget, and require a clearer plan for handling tariff downside scenarios."}, "GLOX": {"ticker": "GLOX", "direction": "SHORT", "overall_ok": true, "guardrail_flags": ["tariff_headwind_catalyst", "only_partial_offset_to_style_tilt", "book_level_factor_hedging_incomplete"], "risk_assessment": {"gross_exposure_ok": true, "single_name_volatility_moderate": true, "factor_risk_main_driver": false, "borrow_cost_issue": false, "idiosyncratic_alpha_present": true, "tariff_catalyst_path_defined": true, "nmv_reduction_modest": true}, "pm_recommendation": "Approve as a sized, catalyst-driven short that modestly reduces cyclicals NMV and introduces tariff downside exposure, but pair with additional value/cyclical shorts if the goal is to meaningfully balance the portfolio\u2019s quality-growth style tilt."}}}
