## Idea 1: Long Proposal
Ticker: ACME
Direction: LONG
Proposed Notional Size: 5000000
Implied Volatility (60-day): 35
Crowding Indicator: Medium-High
Sector/Theme: High-Growth Software / AI Enablement
Beta: 1.4
Draft Thesis: ACME Corp is poised for a significant re-rating due to its new 'Neuro-Stack' product line, with rapid enterprise adoption and underappreciated 2027 revenue potential. Catalysts include Q4 earnings and a major analyst day in Q1.

## Idea 2: Short Proposal
Ticker: BAUX
Direction: SHORT
Proposed Notional Size: 3000000
Implied Volatility (60-day): 20
Crowding Indicator: Low
Sector/Theme: Cyclical Industrials / Raw Materials
Borrow Cost: 4
Days-to-Cover (DTC): 1.0
Idiosyncratic Alpha Estimate: Low
Draft Thesis: BAUX is a short because of poor capital allocation, a cyclical peak in commodity prices, and a pending Q2 legal judgment, with most expected return driven by macro factors rather than idiosyncratic alpha.
